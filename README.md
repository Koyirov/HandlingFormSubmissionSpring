## Handling Form Submission

This guide walks us through the process of using Spring 
to create and submit a web form.

### What You Will Build

In this guide, we will build a web form, which will be 
accessible at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/greeting

Viewing this page in a browser will display the form. 
We can submit a greeting by populating the id and 
content form fields. A results page will be displayed 
when the form is submitted.
